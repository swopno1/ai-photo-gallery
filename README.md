AI-powered **photo management tool** that organizes your photos by **date, event, and faces**.
It detects duplicates, extracts EXIF metadata (date, GPS), clusters faces, and provides a **modern Next.js gallery UI** for browsing â€” all **offline** and privacy-friendly.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Python 3.8+**
-   **Node.js 18.0+**
-   **npm**

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. Then, clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-photo-gallery.git
cd ai-photo-gallery
```

### 2. Set Up the Python Environment

Navigate to the `python_pipeline` directory and create a virtual environment:

```bash
cd python_pipeline
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Process Your Photos

Place your photos in the `photos_folder` directory. Then, run the processing script:

```bash
python process_photos.py --input ../photos_folder
```

This will organize your photos, detect faces, and create a `photos.db` file in the `python_pipeline` directory.

### 4. Set Up and Run the Frontend

Navigate back to the root directory and install the npm packages:

```bash
cd ..
npm install
```

Run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the photo gallery.

## ðŸ¤– Offline AI and Privacy

This project is designed to be **100% offline**. All AI processing, including face detection and clustering, happens locally on your machine.

-   **No data is sent to the cloud.**
-   **No external AI services are used.**
-   **Your photos and personal data remain private.**

The face recognition feature is powered by the `face_recognition` library, which uses a pre-trained model to find faces in your photos.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

The core of this project is the Python script `python_pipeline/process_photos.py`. When you run this script, it performs the following steps:

1.  **Initializes a SQLite Database**: Creates a `photos.db` file to store all the metadata about your photos.
2.  **Scans the Input Folder**: Recursively scans the folder you provide as input.
3.  **Detects Duplicates**: Calculates a hash for each photo to identify and move exact duplicates to the `duplicates` folder.
4.  **Extracts EXIF Metadata**: Reads the EXIF data from each photo to get the date taken and GPS coordinates.
5.  **Organizes Photos**: Creates folders based on the year and month the photos were taken and moves the photos into them.
6.  **Detects Faces**: Uses the `face_recognition` library to find all faces in each photo.
7.  **Saves Metadata**: Saves all the extracted information (file path, date, event, faces, etc.) into the SQLite database.

The Next.js frontend then reads the `photos.db` database to display the photo gallery.
